This code repository contains the following folders and files:


FOLDERS:

data: 
This folder contains 2 sub folders: trial and test. The trial subfolder is used for development of the models; the test subfolder set is used for evaluation. 
Both sub folders contain 4 files: 
- 2 files without annotations: the original file (tsar2022_en_[trial or test]_none.tsv) and the cleaned file (tsar2022_en_[trial or test]_none_no_noise.tsv)*. 
- 2 files including annotations (the gold files): the original file (tsar2022_en_[trial or test]_gold.tsv)and the cleaned file ((tsar2022_en_[trial or test]_gold_no_noise.tsv)*. 

For more information about how the cleaned files were created see: 'datafiles_preprocessing.ipynb'.

----------------------------------------

predictions: 
This folder contains 2 sub folders: trial and test. The trial subfolder contains files with predictions for the trial file, the test subfolder contains files with predictions for the test file. The naming of the files corresponds to the model characteristics. The predictions are generated by the .ipynb files mentioned at 'FILES' in this README.

-----------------------------------------

output: 
This folder contains 2 sub folders: trial and test. The trial subfolder contains files with the evaluation output for the trial file, the test subfolder contains files with the evaluation output for the test file. The naming of the files correspond to the model characterics. The outputs are generated by the .ipynb files mentioned at 'FILES' in this README.

FILES (the numbered order below is in accordance with the order if you want to reproduce the results):


1. requirements.txt: the requirements in order to run the code in this repository.

2. datafiles_preprocessing.ipynb: code that removes unwanted characters from the sentences in the datafiles in data/trial and data/test. 
This was needed as the evaluation code returned errors for sentences that contained those characters. 
For example, see ./data/trial/ tsar2022_en_trial_none: the third sentence starts with #34-3 ". Sentences that started with a similar structure had those characters removed, and the resulting files without those characters were stored in the data/trial and data/test folder with the extension '_no_noise'.  These files were used for evaluating the the evaluation script 'eval.py'. For verification purposes, the original files are also stored in the data/trial and data/test folders.

Furthermore, this notebook includes preprocessing actions for the CEFR datasets used. For the availability of these datasets, see the note at the bottom of this README. 


- several files for the trial set:
utils.py: utils script used in evaluation files for trial set.
3. evaluations_SG_SS_phase1_6models_trial.ipynb. This file corresponds to the results presented in sections 4.1 and 4.2 of the thesis. 
4. evaluations_SG_SS_phase1+2_best2models_trial.ipynb. This file corresponds to the results presented in section 4.3 of the thesis. 
5. evaluations_SR_Hyper-Hypo_trial.ipynb. This file corresponds to the results presented in section 4.4.1 of the thesis.
6. evaluations_SR_CEFR_trial.ipynb. This file corresponds to the results presented in section 4.4.2 of the thesis.


- several files for the test set:
utils_test.py: utils script used in evaluation files for test set.
7. evaluations_SG_SS_phase1+2_test.ipynb. This file corresponds to the results presented in sections 5.1, 5.2, and 5.4 of the thesis.
8. evaluations_SR_Hyper-Hypo_test.ipynb. This file corresponds to the results presented in sections 5.1 and 5.2 of the thesis.
9. evaluations_SR_CEFR_test.ipynb. This file corresponds to the results presented in sections 5.1 and 5.2 of the thesis.
10. post-evaluations_SR_Hyper-Hypo_test. This file corresponds to the post-evaluation experiments and results presented in section 5.5 of the thesis. 
11. post-evaluations_SR_CEFR_test. This file corresponds to the post-evaluation analysis presented in section 6.4 of the thesis.


- the following evaluation scripts:
tsar_eval-orig_noEncoding.py: original pre-supplied script that gave an UnicodeDecodeError due to missing 'encoding = utf-8' command, which I added to the script at the appropriate places and saved to tsar_eval.py. See next file. Therefore, tsar_eval-orig_noEncoding.py is not used for evaluation.

tsar_eval.py: pre-supplied script (with small update to correct an error, see above file 'tsar_eval-orig_noEncoding.py'), to calculate the 10 evaluation metrics. This script is called in the evaluations and post-evaluations files mentioned above.

Note that the used CEFR datasets, due to their restricted licenses, are not included in this (public) upload of my repository. However, these files will be made available for internal (VU) academic use.
